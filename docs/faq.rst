Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

How do I use this?
------------------

Ahah! A perfect guide has been written for you already! Please see :ref:`usage information <how_to_use>`.

Is it Hypixel.py or hypixel.py or HyPiXeL.pY?
---------------------------------------------

It is definitely "hypixel.py". Nothing else. Everything else is wrong. >:C

Who the heck are you?
---------------------

I'm Snuggle! A moderator for the Hypixel Network and a bit more.
I'm also known for my `Hypixel-bot <https://sprinkly.net/hypixelbot>`_ project and you can see more information about me at https://sprinkly.net.

Can I contribute?
-----------------

You are completely free to contribute, if you'd like! It would really help out and will help make this library as useful as possible.

Not all code and contributions can be added, though, for various reasons. I will try my best to accept as many useful contributions as possible, but please don't be upset if your pull request doesn't get merged.

I'd like to thank you for contributing and I'm sorry for my messy code. ü§£ ‚ù§
