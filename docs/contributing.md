# Contributing to Hypixel.py

You are completely free to contribute, if you'd like! It would really help out and will help make this library as useful as possible.

Not all code and contributions can be added, though, for various reasons. I will try my best to accept as many useful contributions as possible, but please don't be upset if your pull request doesn't get merged.

I'd like to thank you for contributing and I'm sorry for my messy code. ü§£ ‚ù§
